Data Science Daily Works Repository

Overview

This repository documents my daily progress in the field of Data Science, Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL). It serves as a collection of my learnings, projects, and experiments. The initial focus is on Week 1, which involves:

Data Collection: Using web scraping and APIs to gather data.

Data Visualization: Representing the collected data using Power BI and Tableau.

Database Creation: Organizing the data in a structured manner using MySQL.

Week 1: Data Collection and Visualization

1. Data Collection

Objective: Collect data from various sources, including websites and APIs.

Tools Used:

Python libraries: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, requests

APIs from relevant platforms (e.g., Twitter, OpenWeather, or custom APIs)

2. Data Visualization

Objective: Create interactive and insightful visualizations to explore and present the collected data.

Tools Used:

Power BI: Used for creating dashboards and business intelligence visualizations.

Tableau: Employed for advanced data visualization and storytelling.

3. Database Creation

Objective: Store the collected and processed data for efficient retrieval and analysis.

Tools Used:

MySQL: Used for creating and managing relational databases.

SQL Scripts: For organizing, querying, and managing data.

Goals for Week 2

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Initial implementation of ML models
